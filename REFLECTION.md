This was interesting I definitely got some results I wasn't expecting. For one, I am on one of my devices more than I sleep (this is concerning).
Also, I tend to sleep more on days I work on my game. This one is more correlation than causation I'm guessing because of the weekends. I didn't track
caffine because I don't drink it. Using my own data was really interesting and helped me make connections I hadn't before. I really like javascript's
object system.
